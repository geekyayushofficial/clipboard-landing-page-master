## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- DESKTOP-first workflow

### What I learned

When I was starting this project, since I am beginner at this point of time, I faced a lot of difficulties choosing the correct class names, then applied the BEM convention for this. I also had problem choosing the components and layouts etc. in the 7-1 architecture of SASS, but through a lot of focus, hard-work and ofc Google Searches, I figured out these. Rest I used FlexBox for the layout, so got a good practice of it too...

### Continued development

In future I want to focus on CSS Grids and then using JavaScript too
